CVImageDenoiseiOS
=================

This is a simple project that demonstates the use of OpenCV for post-processing of images. Images can be captured from the camera or selected from the Photo Library, and gaussian white noise can be denoised from that image.
The function used for denoising is fastNlMeansDenoisingColored. More about this function can be read from the OpenCV docs.
